   a. double click the file icon for vds_movies.py (it is assumed that
      a file with the '.py' extension will run the Python version 2.x interpreter)

   or,

   b. at a command-line prompt type the following command (it is assumed that
      the 'python' command runs the Python version 2.x interpreter):

      `C:\Users\User\movies> python vds_movies.py`

      the 'python' command runs the Python version 2.x interpreter):

      `user_mac: user_movies user$ python vds_movies.py`

### What to expect on either platform

vds_movies.py will launch a web page displaying an array of movie poster images indicating the title, release date, and primary actors.

Clicking on any one of the poster images will open a window on the web page and display a trailer for the selected movie. Clicking 'X' in the upper right corner of the video window will close the trailer.

Exit the web page by clicking 'X' in the upper right corner of the tab or web
   page window.
